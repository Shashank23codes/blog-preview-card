## My Process

### Built With

### What I Learned

While working on this project, I learned how to:

- Use **CSS custom properties** for consistent theming.
- Implement **responsive design** using media queries.
- Create hover effects for interactive elements.

Hereâ€™s an example of a hover effect I implemented:

```css
h2:hover {
  color: var(--Yellow);
  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```
